With these experiments, we aim to increase our ability to target an experiment to that population accurately.  This will involve 3 experiments all setting a dummy pref - so there will be no changes to the user. The experiment will just enroll users into a branch and then we'll evaluate through existing telemetry if those users truly are \"new users\" after the fact.","enrollmentId":"21957479-cb8c-4472-9eb9-8479074ea444","temporaryErrorDeadline":null}}}
